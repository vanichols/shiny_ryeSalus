**How to read the bottom figure**
- Choose a cover crop planting date from the *top labels* that seems reasonable for your system. 
- Choose a spring termination date on the *left axis*.
- The mountain sitting on your termination date represents the likelihoods of having a given amount of cover crop biomass upon termination, labeled on the *bottom axis*. 
    + The peak of the mountain is the most probable value for your chosen county, based on the past 30 years of weather. 
    + A small mountain indicates the cover crop failed to establish in some years.
